RC Car made with Arduino

## Libraries

Before editing and compiling the code using the Ardunino IDE, you need to copy the libraries from _lib/_ to the IDE libraries folder if it is not already there.

```cp -r lib/{AFMotor,NewPing} ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/```

After that, you need to reastart the IDE.
